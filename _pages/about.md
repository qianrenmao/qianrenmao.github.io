AboutMe
======

I am now a Research Scientist, **<span style="color:#0969da;">**Zhongguancun Laboratory**</span>**, Beijing, China.  
I received my Ph.D. in 2022 from [Beihang University](https://www.buaa.edu.cn/), supervised by Prof. Jianxin Li [![Google Scholar](https://img.shields.io/badge/scholar-14000%2B-blue?logo=googlescholar)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EY2lqD0AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao).  
Prior to that, I obtained both my Master’s and Bachelor’s degrees from China West Normal University and was officially recognized as an “Excellent Graduate of Sichuan Province” by the Sichuan Provincial Department of Education.

My research centers on **LLMs** & **NLP**, spanning knowledge reasoning, textual reasoning, and retrieval-augmented generation.  
I am now extending this work to **data security**, particularly trustworthy data flows in emerging paradigms such as [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) and [A2A](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/a2a-a-new-era-of-agent-interoperability/).
