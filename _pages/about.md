About Me
======

I am now a Research Scientist, **<span style="color:#0969da;">Zhongguancun Laboratory</span>**, in Beijing, China. I received my Ph.D. in 2022 from <span style="color:#0969da;">[Beihang University](https://www.buaa.edu.cn/)</span>, supervised by Prof. Jianxin Li [![Google Scholar](https://img.shields.io/badge/scholar-14000%2B-blue?logo=googlescholar)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EY2lqD0AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). Before that, I earned both my Master’s and Bachelor’s degrees from China West Normal University and was recognized as an **Excellent Graduate of Sichuan Province** by the Sichuan Provincial Department of Education.


My research focuses on **LLMs & NLP**, covering knowledge reasoning, textual reasoning, and retrieval-augmented generation. I am also extending this work to **Data Security**, particularly trustworthy data flows in emerging paradigms such as <span style="color:#0969da;">[**MCP**](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction)</span> and <span style="color:#0969da;">[**A2A**](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/a2a-a-new-era-of-agent-interoperability/)</span>.

> **Prospective Students**
