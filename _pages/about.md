AboutMe
======

I am now a Research Scientist, **<span style="color: #0969da;">Zhongguancun Laboratory</span>**, in Beijing, China. I received the Ph.D. degree in 2022 from [Beihang University](https://www.buaa.edu.cn), supervised by Prof. Jianxin Li [![Google Scholar](https://img.shields.io/badge/scholar-14000%2B-blue?logo=googlescholar)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EY2lqD0AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). Prior to that, I obtained both my Master’s and Bachelor’s degrees from China West Normal University and was officially recognized as an “Excellent graduates from Sichuan Province” by the Sichuan Provincial Department of Education.


My research centers on LLMs & NLP, spanning knowledge reasoning, textual reasoning, and retrieval-augmented generation. I am also expanding into data security, particularly trustworthy data flows in emerging paradigms such as [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) and [A2A](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/a2a-a-new-era-of-agent-interoperability).


[Prospective students] Our group has positions for PhD students (Joint Education Programs with Beihang University), and visiting students. If you are interested, please send me an email with your CV and publications (if any).
